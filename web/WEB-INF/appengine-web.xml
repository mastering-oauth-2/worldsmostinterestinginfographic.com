        Version history

        [v1]
        Initial proof-of-concept.  Able to fetch profile data and feed posts vis OAuth 2.0 and displays basic statistics.


        [v2]
        First pass at integrating website design.


        [v3]
        Much more mature version.  Fetch all data upon authorization before displaying charts.  Submitted to Facebook.
        Error'd too many times because of long wait time while fetching feed data.  Need to optimize


        [v4]
        Cleaned up architecture.  Now displays infographic page as soon as receiving profile data.  Then proceeds to
        request chart data asynchronously from server via AJAX call.  Much better performance.  Submitted once again to
        Facebook.  Approved!  Prototyping complete and all checks covered.  Now ready to throw away existing codebase
        and start building the real production version of this application.


        [v5]
        Starting from scratch.  First attempt at real production site.


        [v6]
        We're live!

        Allows App Engine to send multiple requests to one instance in parallel:

    <!--
        HTTP Sessions are disabled by default. To enable HTTP sessions specify:

          <sessions-enabled>true</sessions-enabled>

        It's possible to reduce request latency by configuring your application to
        asynchronously write HTTP session data to the datastore:

          <async-session-persistence enabled="true" />

        With this feature enabled, there is a very small chance your app will see
        stale session data. For details, see
        http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/appconfig.html#Enabling_Sessions
      -->
    <sessions-enabled>true</sessions-enabled>
